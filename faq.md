## ART ADVISORY & AFTER CARE
------
### How should I store my artwork?
We’d advise you to remove artwork from tubes at your earliest convenience. Whilst a print can stay in a tube for the short term, it should not be seen as a long-term storage solution. It is preferable that an artwork is allowed to uncurl naturally before being framed. An un-framed artwork should otherwise be kept in a flat file.
<br/><br/>
### How should I frame my artwork?
We’d encourage you to frame artwork to conservation standards using a reputable framer. Choosing a sympathetic frame can drastically change the look and feel of an artwork for the better. We are always happy to offer our recommendations.
<br/><br/>
### How can I ensure the artwork remains in pristine condition during its lifetime?
Unfortunately, many great artworks have been permanently damaged over the years due to being kept in inadequate conditions. To avoid sunlight discoloration, use UV protected glazing for your artwork and keep away from a direct light source. Do not hang artwork close to a heat source or an area of high moisture. Paper can be very sensitive to moisture and is susceptible to damp. Finally, ensure artwork is hung according to the weight of the piece using high quality fixtures.
